= Enhanced Axios Typescript Code generator

This is intended to be submitted back to the OpenAPI Generator crew because there are a number of tickets
raised around its poor serialization and deserialization of data, date formatting, and support for alternative
formats (such as uuids, emails, etc).

At the moment it is generating "correct" code, as in Typescript is ok with it, but it is otherwise untested.

It needs to:

- change the APIs to actually use the toJson and fromJson methods
- support oneOf's and discriminators (lower priority)

I have tested it on taffy for code gen only and it seems happy except for the NSW gas because of the discriminator.
